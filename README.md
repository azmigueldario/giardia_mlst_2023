# Project: **Giardia _cgMLST_ 2023**

## Approach

- Collect publicly available and in-house genomes of Assemblages A an B.
- Normalize and apply quality control tools to raw reads
- Produce annotated and verified genomes for all parasites
- Apply Chewbacca tool to define a core-genome MLST approach

## Datasets

Secondary data analysis project to produce a core-genome multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) approach to _Giardia duodenalis_ assemblages A and B parasites
